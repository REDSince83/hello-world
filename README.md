First Steps From the GitHub guides

Hi, I'm Ray a graphic designer who is fascinated with learning new things.
It's 2017 and I want to learn more about development, GitHub, Animation, Lettering
Video, Photography and all things creative. I not only want to learn but would like
to implement what I learn effectively. Thus my initial commit!
